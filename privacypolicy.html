        <strong>How we share your information</strong>
        <br />
        <br /> MOBIWHIZ.COM will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Statement. MOBIWHIZ.COM shares personal information in the following ways: MOBIWHIZ.COM retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist MOBIWHIZ.COM with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of MOBIWHIZ.COM and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for MOBIWHIZ.COM. From time to time, MOBIWHIZ.COM participates in marketing initiatives with other companies. As part of these initiatives, certain MOBIWHIZ.COM services and marketing communications are delivered at the same time as those from other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both MOBIWHIZ.COM and the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from MOBIWHIZ.COM and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, MOBIWHIZ.COM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is MOBIWHIZ.COM's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
